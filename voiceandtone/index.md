## Voice and tone

### Voice

1. Friendly 

For my introverted personality, it’s important to collaborate with like-minded, kind individuals, so my voice should be an example of what kind of people I would like to collaborate with on projects.

2. Authentic 

My voice should be the closest to my personality.
+ But my personality in professional mood.:D

3. Simple

### Tone

Depending... As it is in normal life your tone also sounds similar with clients communication...

1. I would like to sound friendly but also representative

3. Professional

4. Kind and humble


### Style 

My style would be simple and clear without unnecessary words.

1. Easy to read

2. Keep things kind of personal 

It is not necessary sound like robot, add some emojis and show clients that they can know you through your words a little bit. They fear you as much as you fear them. :D

3. Open and honest 

It’s important to say things as they are specific to our field. And being honest makes everyone’s job easier, especially if you work in a team.
