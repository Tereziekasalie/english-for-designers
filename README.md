![PHOTO of me, invitating smile.](niceme.PNG)

I am a graphic designer passionate about illustrations. I study  at the University in Prague for graphic designer. I still kind of finding myself so I'm exited about new experiences. Because my calm and friendly personality Ican cooperate really well in teams.
 I love drawing, painting everything what touches art a bit, so I would describe myself more like an artist. I have been always creative being since childhood I created crazy things and it was always something extra sometimes it wasn't the best work. But I always loved it and that's the most important.
I love to spend time with my pets and do collective sports with friends.

### KOBE GASTRO GROUP

We received the KOBE GASTRO GROUP project as a group at the VSKK University. In the number of 5 people, we created a new logo for the main brand of several restaurants and competed with other teams from the school. First, we started researching how other umbrella restaurants look. After consulting with the project leader teachers, we created the first designs. I present you our logo from basic sketches

First ideas

 One of the most important things is the representing element of the KOBE GASTRO GROUP. That's why we started with it immediately after research.
