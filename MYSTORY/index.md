I am a graphic designer passionate about illustrations. I study at the University in Prague for graphic designer. I still kind of finding myself so I'm exited about new experiences. Because my calm and friendly personality Ican cooperate really well in teams.  I love drawing, painting everything what touches art a bit, so I would describe myself more like an artist. I have been always creative being since childhood I created crazy things and it was always something extra sometimes it wasn't the best work. 
But I always loved it and that's the most important. I love to spend time with my pets and do collective sports with friends.
