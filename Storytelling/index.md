## Storytelling

There are lot of things that can take away our attention. But the one thing that does it the most…

It’s the thing that everyone has.

#### And it's your phone!

Today it’s hard not to have a phone at all.

It’s a big part of our life.

You need it like a child because of good relationships with classmates.

Contact friend, because of your business…

#### We live in a world where inactivity on social media equals social death.

#### But is it a necessity? 

There is one thing that we should realize. And that’s the quality of life we have without social media.

Probably… If it’s good enough, we are happy and don’t need it that much.

It reminds me of when people start dating and suddenly disappear from social media, and no one knows about them.

Because they spend time together and have no need, at least at beginning.

#### What’s the world average…

If someone can spend six hours and 42 minutes on their phone, how good can their life be if they spend most of their day watching someone else’s life?

What is worse is that that’s not even the worst because Filipinos spent at least 10 hours a day on the phone.

#### 7 years just looking at your phone.

If you spent only 53 minutes a day on your phone instead of 2 hours and 53 minutes and then spent those extra 2 hours a day learning a new language in exchange for looking at endless videos before going to sleep, you could be speaking seven languages fluently in 7 years.

#### Choose a logo that you know a well… Something like Nike, adidas, or Chanel.

Deconstruct a logo by breaking it down into basic shapes and elements (circles, shapes and lines).
