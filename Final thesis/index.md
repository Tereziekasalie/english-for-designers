Final thesis presentation


I chose to redesign small fruit winery. I really liked that winery produce their wines with respect to nature but they are not able to present it right way.

I chose this winery because they try to do their wines naturally and without unnecessary sugar and chemicals. 

So at the first glance, it was for me like the the winery be good for using my illustrations what I do. Because of the company philosophy and their respectful connection to the nature. 

There you can see the web design what they use. They try to point out their relationship with nature but not in the right way.

Labels for their wines are visually connected together, but it doesn't seems different from others. 
They are not significant on the market.
 
## Research 

I made some research.. to see what what the company competition is like.

This is the biggest producer of fruit wine on our market. They have limited editions and very expressive labels. 

And because of the visuals they also seems like cheap versions of the fruit wines.

But against others they communicate with their clients somehow…

this is another competitive company that doesn’t stand out at all in the market.

And another. They have in common that both labels are not distinctive and probably uninteresting at the first glance.

I’ve been thinking from the beginning that I wanted to work by using illustrations and tell a nature fairy tale story.

I was looking for how the place where the wines are made, could be connected to something super natural.

And I found the connection of classic check Devils to the place that is close to winery.
But as it happens my leader disagreed.

So I kept looking, and after a while, I came up with the idea of connecting the wine to the fairies, who are connected to nature on the different level than devils.
