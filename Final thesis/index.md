## Final thesis presentation

I chose to redesign small fruit winery. 

I really liked that winery produce their wines with respect to nature but they are not able to present it right way.

I chose this winery because they try to do their wines naturally and without unnecessary sugar and chemicals. 

So at the first glance, it was for me like the the winery be good for using my illustrations what I do. Because of the company philosophy and their respectful connection to the nature. 

There you can see the web design what they use. They try to point out their relationship with nature but not in the right way.

Labels for their wines are visually connected together, but it doesn't seems different from others. 
They are not significant on the market.

## Research 

I made some research to see what what the company competition is like.

This is the biggest producer of fruit wine on our market. They have limited editions and very expressive labels. 

And because of the visuals they also seems like cheap versions of the fruit wines.

But against others they communicate with their clients somehow.

This is another competitive company that doesn’t stand out at all in the market.

And more. They have in common that both labels are not distinctive and probably uninteresting at the first glance.

## First idea

I’ve been thinking from the beginning that I wanted to work by using illustrations and tell a nature fairytale story.

I was looking for how the place where the wines are made, could be connected to something supernatural.

And I found the connection of classic check devils to the place that is close to winery.

But as it happens my leader disagreed.

## First skeches

So I kept looking, and after a while I came up with the idea of connecting the wine to the fairies who are connected to nature on the different level than devils.

Here you can see my first sketches and how I tried to add a fairy word into the label. 
At the same time me and my leader decided put wines in 4 categories. 

So from here I knew the way I want to go.

## Moodboard

My inspiration was mainly the variability of nature, the connection with it. 

The elements of unpredictability and mother nature herself.

I also wanted to add a fairytale wine story to the brand. I try to show this with a fairytale dropcap. 

I was also inspired by Chanel and its name. This helps to keep unity and fairytale secrets.

## Logo 

I tried to keep it simple, because logo isn’t our main communication element. 

So I let it rotate according to how the sun rises in seasons.

In summer for example the day is the longest, so for summer I chose the longest position of the letter o.

## Ilustrations 

Ilustrations were made to reflect seasons and taste of wines. 

The four created categories are reflected in their names. This helps to create a unified and also makes it possible to classify the wines according to taste and freshness into these categories.

## Pattern 

For winery social media I created pattern what they can use as they want to. And also keep visual style of instagram. 
Instagram communicate also by seasons.

## Instagram

The company should communicate on Instagram differently in each season both with color tonality and overall atmosphere in order to attract customers to the products that are most popular at the given time.

In summer for example they promote the freshness and lightness of wines.

In winter on the other hand wines with more pronounced flavors that can be warmed up so that clients can enjoy them by the fireplace and good food.

On the proposal I connect the everyday world and incorporate a fairytale world into it. 

With this the company tries to inspire unique experiences and develop the customer's imagination not only when drinking Pankovo. wine.

I use an illustrated photography that aims to point out the fact that Pankovo winery thinks about nature and its gifts in a different way.

For photos that focus more on products such as photos of wines a pattern is designed that can be used by desie of the owner.

I always apply the text to a uniform colored background in the totality of the given period.

I reflect into it the ideas of the concept as a relationship with nature and the telling of fairytales.

## Web 

I made the website in such a way that it visually matches the whole identity of Pankovo.

The customer gets to know the philosophy of the company and its story. 

Here I emphasize nature, nature and relationships. 

The world of fantasy is shown only on the main page of the website where I insert the white illustrations directly into the video which customers will see first.

## Gift bag for wine

I chose a gift bag which is made of strong handmade paper as a gift for the purchase of an order over 1000 CZK.

As part of sustainability we can insert fruit seeds into the paper when making the bags.

If the bag was no longer usable, the customer could use its added value plant it in the garden and let it grow for example a beautiful currant bush.

I show the variability of the season in the bags with the help of their colors the elements inserted into them but also their structure.
