## Final thesis presentation

I chose to redesign small fruit winery. I really liked that winery produce their wines with respect to nature but they are not able to present it right way.

I chose this winery because they try to do their wines naturally and without unnecessary sugar and chemicals. 

So at the first glance, it was for me like the the winery be good for using my illustrations what I do. Because of the company philosophy and their respectful connection to the nature. 

There you can see the web design what they use. They try to point out their relationship with nature but not in the right way.

Labels for their wines are visually connected together, but it doesn't seems different from others. 
They are not significant on the market.
 
## Research 

I made some research.. to see what what the company competition is like.

This is the biggest producer of fruit wine on our market. They have limited editions and very expressive labels. 

And because of the visuals they also seems like cheap versions of the fruit wines.

But against others they communicate with their clients somehow…

this is another competitive company that doesn’t stand out at all in the market.

And another. They have in common that both labels are not distinctive and probably uninteresting at the first glance.

## First idea

I’ve been thinking from the beginning that I wanted to work by using illustrations and tell a nature fairy tale story.

I was looking for how the place where the wines are made, could be connected to something super natural.

And I found the connection of classic check Devils to the place that is close to winery.
But as it happens my leader disagreed.

## First skeches

So I kept looking, and after a while, I came up with the idea of connecting the wine to the fairies, who are connected to nature on the different level than devils.

Here you can see my first sketches and how I tried to add a fairy word into the label. 
At the same time me and my leader decided put wines in 4 categories. 

So from here I knew the way I want to go.

## Moodboard

My inspiration was mainly the variability of nature, the connection with it. 

The elements of unpredictability and mother nature herself.

I also wanted to add a fairy-tale wine story to the brand. I try to show this with a fairy-tale dropcap. 

I was also inspired by Chanel and its name. This helps to keep unity and fairytale secrets.

## Logo 

I tried to keep it simple, because logo isn’t our main communication element. 
So I let it rotate according to how the sun rises in seasons.
In summer, for example, the day is the longest, so for summer I chose the longest position of the letter o.
