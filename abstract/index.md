#### Abstract:
The thesis deals with the creation of a new visual identity for the existing winery called Pankovo, which focuses on production of wines made from fruits. The theoretical part of the work consists of the definition of the concept from the graphic environment and a survey of the competition of the market in which the company is located. 
	Within the framework of the knowledge arising from it creates a new design and aims to increase awareness of the company, but also to change the current view of the brand and improve its place on the market.
	The resulting design should add certainty and uniqueness to the wine, thereby helping to change the overall perception of fruit wines on the domestic market. The entire design is accompanied by illustrations that represent the companyâ€™s values in a customer friendly manner.
