### 1) What did you like most about this course?

That I never had to be afraid of anything, especially making a mistake. Thanks to that, I always felt good in class.

### 2) What did you like least about this course?

Sometimes it was hard to stay focused while watching long videos or during a long monologue. But when we did various exercises in class as at the beginning of storytelling or consulting ideas with classmates. When there was a bit of interaction in the class, you can relax for 5-10 minutes with these exercises, then it is much more pleasant and it is easier to continue listening.

### 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

I definitely learned how to use github even though its very basic :D 
I also learned how to create a good presentation also thanks to that I had the opportunity to see awesome presentations from classmates that you normally cannot see and on interesting topics with great metaphors.
And and lastly I learned that I'm still learning and that it's not a problem if I screw something up as long as I want to fix it and work on the mistakes. I think this is a big difference in "American and Czech teaching" which is much more likeable to me. :)

### 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

I liked every activity during which we interacted a bit like describing a picture or like I said discussing ideas with classmates.

### 5) Whatâ€™s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

I am proud of everything I have completed this year like subjects and bachelor's thesis but also things in my personal life. This year was very challenging and that's another thing I learned in our class! And its that I have to be proud of my work and be more confident about it.

### 6) Whatâ€™s one thing you learned about yourself?

I learned not to underestimate myself so much and feel more confident about my work! And that's mostly thanks to the fact that you always encouraged me a little and then I realized that my work could have meaning. :) 

### 7) Whatâ€™s one thing you could have done better?

I could prepare more and better for classes. Sometimes it took me longer to create a presentation and not be afraid to present it. But I'm working on it :/ :D :)

### ðŸ˜Ž Whatâ€™s one thing I could have done better?

I would add just one small thing and that's what I already mentioned it would be great to add more activities, examples, exercises in the lessons. Otherwise I really liked the classes mainly the atmosphere and the incredible neverending good mood! It always made me feel better even if I wasn't in the mood.

### 9) Whatâ€™s one thing you would add or change about this course?

I have already mentioned only thing I would change and I have no to say. The classes were always great! There was always a human and friendly approach that not many people have! Thank you, keep going.

### 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

That this year will go really fast. Try to not procrastinate and ask for some feedback on your work.
